# READme Generator

## Project Description
To save time building a professional README, this README generator works in the command line using markdown syntax from user input to then generate a professional README. This saves time and effort in a project's phase.

## How to Use
Clone the repo and install packages with npm i in an integrated terminal. Then enter node index.js to start the application. The user will be prompted with several questions:

	"What is your GitHub user name?",
    "What is your project title?",
    "What is your project description?",
    "Enter a Table of Contents",
    "What steps are required to install your project?",
    "Show instructions for use.",
	"List collaborators and any tutorials used.",
    "List any tests and how to run them.",
	"List any licenses' your project may include.
